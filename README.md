# CP Pattern Practice Platform

[Demo to the website](https://6863f83b8526b168054c799e--amazing-tiramisu-776a6a.netlify.app/)

This project is made to help people practice Competitive Programming (CP) based on problem patterns (like DP, graphs, greedy, etc.).

## Why I Built This

I wanted to create a simple and organized way for others to practice CP questions based on patterns. It can be hard to know what to solve next, so this platform gives a clear path.

## Tech Stack

* **SvelteKit** – used for building the frontend and backend (for some ssr).
* **Custom Docker-based Online Judge** – used for compiling and running code submissions (under development).
* **Database** - (will be added) - supabase/pocketbase along with drizzle ORM

### Note - some other features like state management like (authentication and authorization will be added)

## Status

**This project is still under development.**
Features and problems will be added gradually.

## Goal

Make CP learning and practice easier and more structured for everyone.
